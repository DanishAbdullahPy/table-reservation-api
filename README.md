 
The Scenario: To manage table availability effectively, a system is required to temporarily "lock" a table while a user completes their booking. This mechanism is crucial for preventing simultaneous double-bookings of the same table. Your Task: Develop the core API logic for this functionality by creating a "Table Reservation Lock" API. Specific Deliverable: Construct a set of REST API endpoints designed to facilitate the temporary reservation of a table. Requirements & Tech Stack: ● Tech Stack: Node.js with Express.js. ● Database: Utilize an in-memory solution (e.g., a simple JavaScript object or array) for storing lock records. No external database setup is necessary. ● API Endpoints: 1. POST /api/tables/lock ■ Request Body: `{ "tableId": "table-123", "userId": "user-abc", "duration": 600 }` (duration to be specified in seconds). ■ Logic: ■ Verify if the `tableId` is already subject to a lock. ■ If no lock exists, create a new lock record containing the `tableId`, `userId`, and an `expiry timestamp` (calculated as `currentTime + duration`). ■ Respond with a `200 OK` status and the body `{ "success": true, "message": "Table locked successfully." }`. ■ If the table is already locked, return a `409 Conflict` status with the body `{ "success": false, "message": "Table is currently locked by another user." }`. 2. POST /api/tables/unlock ■ Request Body: `{ "tableId": "table-123", "userId": "user-abc" }` ■ Logic: ■ Remove the lock associated with the provided `tableId` only if the `userId` in the request matches the `userId` that established the original lock. ■ Respond with a `200 OK` status. 3. GET /api/tables/:tableId/status ■ Logic: ■ Determine if a lock exists for the specified `tableId` and ascertain if the lock has expired. ■ Respond with a `200 OK` status and the body `{ "isLocked": true/false }`. Deliverables: ● A publicly accessible GitHub repository link containing your Node.js/Express project. ● A Postman collection (or equivalent documentation) detailing and demonstrating the testing procedures for each endpoint. Assessment Criteria: ● API Design: Clarity, logical structure, and adherence to RESTful principles in endpoint design. ● Business Logic: Accuracy in implementing the locking and unlocking mechanisms, including comprehensive handling of edge cases. ● Code Quality: Organization, readability, and maintainability of the server-side code. did we satisfied all the checkpoints of these assignment??
